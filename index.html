    <h1>Happy Valentine's Day</h1>

   <p>I neâ€™er was struck before that hour

   <br> With love so sudden and so sweet,
    
  <br>  Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower
    
   <br> And stole my heart away complete.
    
   <br> My face turned pale as deadly pale,
    
   <br> My legs refused to walk away,
    
   <br> And when she looked, what could I ail?
    
   <br> My life and all seemed turned to clay. </br></p>
